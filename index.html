									<h2><a href="#">Hi! Iâ€™m Wira! </a></h2>
									<p>
										Right now Iâ€™m working as a Senior Software Engineer in <a href="https://urbangroup.co.id/">Urban Company</a>,
										 mainly focus on distribution service, product service,
										and developer-platform, such as Distribution/Tracking Product, Activation Automation, Aggregation service, and scale the other system to microservices.
										<br>
I do love solving scaling problem from product perspective. Because I believe no such a silver bullet to help to scale product. And working on product force me to learn and improve myself everytime. I also love to solve engineering problem, like to help the engineers to be able move faster without blocked by manual process.
									</p>
									<p>
										As a Backend developer I'm intresting to learn more about clean code and some principle such as SOLID principle. Learn something new is part of my hobby ecpecially in Technology Industry, because i believe something that didn't change is the change itself.
										That's why before i choosed backend as my path, i was a Mobile Developer for 2y (Flutter) and fullstack developer using Vue and Laravel (Mainstream couple tool) for 3y.
									</p>
